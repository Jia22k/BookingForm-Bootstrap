# Bootstrap Booking Form

This is a simple booking form built with Bootstrap, enhanced with JavaScript functionalities for interactive form handling. It allows users to input personal information, schedule booking dates, and submit their details. This project is part of my Full Stack Web Development class.

## Features

- **User Information Input**: Users can enter their username, first name, and last name.
- **Contact Details**: Inputs for phone number, fax, and email.
- **Booking Schedule**: Users can select check-in and check-out dates, and the application calculates the total cost based on the number of days and adults.
- **Form Validation and Reset**: JavaScript functions ensure that all required fields are filled and allow users to reset the form to its initial state.
